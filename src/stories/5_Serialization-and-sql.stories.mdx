# SQL Conversion

Easily convert queries to SQL using different flavors. Each flavor formats the SQL specifically for a given database engine, ensuring compatibility and optimal performance.

For example, a query using the `month` function can be converted to SQL suitable for MySQL, SQLite, or Amazon Timestream:

<CodePreview
  code={`const q = Q.select().addField(Fn.month('dateColumn')).from('table');
return {
  mysql: q.toSQL(Q.flavors.mysql),
  sqlite: q.toSQL(Q.flavors.sqlite),
  awsTimestream: q.toSQL(Q.flavors.awsTimestream)
};`}
/>

# Serialization & Deserialization

Serialization allows queries to be transferred securely between the client and server, enabling them to be reconstructed on the backend and executed against a database. This is especially useful for distributed applications, caching mechanisms, and logging purposes.

### Serializing on the Client

Convert a query into a serialized format before sending it to the server. This ensures that the query structure remains intact and can be safely transmitted over HTTP or other communication protocols.

<CodePreview code={`return Q.select().from('table').serialize();`} />

### Deserializing on the Server

Reconstruct the serialized query on the backend and convert it into SQL for execution. This allows for dynamic query generation and execution while maintaining security and consistency.

<CodePreview
  code={`const serialized = Q.select().from('table').serialize();
return Q.deserialize(serialized).toSQL(Q.flavors.mysql);`}
/>

Using serialization and deserialization, developers can build efficient client-server architectures where complex queries are created on the frontend and executed on the backend without direct SQL exposure, reducing potential SQL injection risks.
